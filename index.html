        <h3>Peacock</h3>
        <p>
          The Indian peacock (Pavo cristatus) has iridescent blue and green
          plumage, mostly metal-like blue and green. In both species, females
          are a little smaller than males in terms of weight and wingspan, but
          males are significantly longer due to the "tail", also known as a
          "train".
